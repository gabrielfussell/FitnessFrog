# Fitness Frog
## Description
This is a simple CRUD app I created as part of a course on [ASP.NET MVC Forms on TeamTreehouse.com](https://teamtreehouse.com/library/aspnet-mvc-forms). This site is a tracker for fitness activities and allows the user to store the activity type, duration, intensity, and date. The user is able to add, edit, and delete entries. In this project I learned how to implement forms and validation in MVC.

The course provided files of a partially finished project, with the front page and styling already completed. My focus was specifically on the Add, Edit, and Delete functionality. I made minor modifications to the colors used on the site. This project uses a repository class for the user data rather than persisting the data to a database or xml file.

## How to Run
To run this project clone the repository to your local machine and open the .sln file in visual studio. Then run the application using the F5 key.

## Additional Features
A great additional feature for this site would be persisting the entries to a database.
